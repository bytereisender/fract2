## Overview

Security is a central aspect of Fract2 CMS. The system implements multiple security measures to prevent attacks and ensure the integrity of managed data. This document outlines the security considerations and practices implemented in Fract2 CMS.

## Authentication and Authorization

- Passwords are hashed and salted using bcrypt
- Multi-factor authentication (2FA) is supported
- Role-based access control system (RBAC) is implemented
- Automatic account lockout after multiple failed login attempts
- Secure password reset mechanisms

Implementation details:
- Password hashing: `password_hash()` function with BCRYPT algorithm
- 2FA: Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) algorithm
- RBAC: Custom implementation with granular permission controls
- Account lockout: Configurable attempt limit and lockout duration

## Database Security

- Use of prepared statements for all database queries
- Minimal permissions for database users
- Encryption of sensitive data in the database
- Regular backups and secure backup storage

Implementation details:
- Prepared statements: PDO with emulated prepares turned off
- Database user permissions: Principle of least privilege
- Data encryption: AES-256 for sensitive fields
- Backups: Automated daily backups with encryption

## Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention

- Automatic escaping of all outputs through the TWIG templating engine
- Content Security Policy (CSP) implemented
- HTTPOnly and Secure flags set for cookies

Implementation details:
- TWIG auto-escaping: Enabled by default for all variables
- CSP: Strict policy with nonce-based script execution
- Cookies: Secure, HTTPOnly, and SameSite flags set

## Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection

- CSRF tokens for all forms and AJAX requests
- Verification of Origin and Referer headers

Implementation details:
- CSRF tokens: Unique per session, rotated regularly
- Token verification: Server-side check for all state-changing requests

## SQL Injection Prevention

- Use of PDO with prepared statements
- Strict typing and validation of all user inputs
- Use of ORM for complex database operations

Implementation details:
- PDO: Used consistently across all database interactions
- Input validation: Type checking and sanitization for all user inputs
- ORM: Custom lightweight ORM for complex queries

## Secure File Uploads

- Strict file type checking
- Random renaming of uploaded files
- Storage of uploads outside the webroot
- Virus scanning for uploaded files (optional)

Implementation details:
- File type checking: MIME type verification and extension whitelist
- File storage: Dedicated upload directory with restricted permissions
- Virus scanning: Integration with ClamAV (when enabled)

## Secure Configuration

- Sensitive configuration data stored outside the webroot
- Production configurations hide detailed error information
- Secure default settings for all configuration options

Implementation details:
- Configuration storage: Separate directory with restricted access
- Error handling: Custom error pages with minimal information in production
- Default settings: Secure-by-default approach for all configurable options

## Logging and Monitoring

- Detailed logging of all security-relevant events
- Integration possibilities with SIEM systems
- Automatic notifications for suspicious activities

Implementation details:
- Logging: PSR-3 compliant logging with configurable log levels
- SIEM integration: Support for common log formats (e.g., syslog)
- Notifications: Email and/or webhook notifications for critical events

## Regular Updates

- Automatic notifications about available security updates
- Simple update process for core and packages
- Regular security audits of the code

Implementation details:
- Update notifications: Built-in update checker with admin panel integration
- Update process: One-click updates with automatic backup creation
- Security audits: Scheduled automated code analysis and manual reviews

## Security Checklist for Developers

1. Validate and sanitize all user inputs
2. Always use prepared statements for database queries
3. Escape all outputs, especially in templates
4. Implement CSRF protection for all forms and AJAX requests
5. Set secure HTTP headers (e.g., X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection)
6. Use secure random number generators for security-critical operations
7. Implement appropriate error handling and logging
8. Check all files uploaded by users
9. Use HTTPS for all connections
10. Keep all dependencies up to date

## Third-Party Package Security

- Verification of package integrity during installation
- Regular security scans of installed packages
- Isolation of third-party packages to minimize potential impact

Implementation details:
- Package integrity: Checksum verification during package installation
- Security scans: Integration with vulnerability databases
- Package isolation: Sandboxing of third-party code execution

## Data Encryption

- Encryption of sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Secure key management practices
- Support for hardware security modules (HSM) for key storage

Implementation details:
- Data encryption: AES-256 for data at rest, TLS 1.3 for data in transit
- Key management: Secure key generation, rotation, and storage
- HSM support: Integration with common HSM providers

## API Security

- Strong authentication for API access
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Input validation and output encoding for all API endpoints

Implementation details:
- API authentication: OAuth 2.0 with refresh tokens
- Rate limiting: Configurable limits based on user roles and endpoints
- API security: Consistent security practices across all API interactions

By strictly adhering to these security guidelines and continuously reviewing and updating security measures, Fract2 CMS strives to provide a robust and secure content management system.
